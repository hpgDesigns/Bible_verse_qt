Ecclesiasticus contains practical and moral rules and exhortations, frequently arranged according to subject matterâ€”e.g., hypocrisy, generosity, filial respect. Wisdom, personified as Sophia, or Lady Wisdom, delivers an extended discourse on her eternal relationship with God (chapter 24) and is identified with the Mosaic Law (see Torah).
